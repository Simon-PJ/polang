# Polang

## About
Polang is a Teletubby themed programming language. I know nothing about designing programming languages but hopefully I'll learn something through creating this abomination.


## Usage

### Valid Polang program

Polang programs must start with

```
Over the hills and faraway Teletubbies come to play
```
and end with
```
The sun is setting in the sky, Teletubbies say goodbye
```

### Writing to the console

Writing to the console is done via the `Say eh-oh` keyword.

#### Example

```
Say eh-oh "Tinky winky!"
```
